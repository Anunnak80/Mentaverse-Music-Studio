Introduction

My name is Vlad, I’m 43 years, studied SAE in Rotterdam, and graduated as Audio Engineer.
Since then, I’m running my own recording / mixing studio for at least 20 years now, in The Netherlands. My idea is to build a virtual, interactive, online music studio, so everyone worldwide can create music together.

This idea came from my i.r.l. job, over at https://www.hvbrecords.nl .
We guide people with mental problems like: light autism, psychoses, split personalities, army veterans, people who suffer from substance abuse, ex-convicts, etc etc, how to write, create, record, mix and promote their own music. This way we help them to escape from their daily sorrows and feel more confident.

Music has the power to prevent people from suicide!

I am also the founder of Mentaverse.

Mentaverse is short for Mental Verse, as we cheer for better mental health, worldwide.
We also believe that we, humans, are wearing the universe inside ourselves.



 


https://incomeisland.org is one of Mentaverse’s partner projects. They are a photo realistic metaverse platform, that give brands the opportunity to run their businesses in there.
When i told them about this idea of mine, they kindly donated us a very nice, piece of land in their metaverse, for free!

What I would like to build in there, is a virtual online music-production studio, that gives everyone access, to join and create songs, together, from wherever they are at that moment and without needing to own expensive studio software.

We got the piece of land for free, but we still need to build everything on it.



 

 

The Plan

We need roughly 16,000 usd to hire coders, developers and designers to build our virtual building/compound, with a fully detailed and smoothly working lobby (forum), studio and performance stage inside.
The group of mental clients, that I work with in real life, amaze me every time, how musical and talented they are, and it gives me hope to see them shine and revive with happiness, the moment they start playing or singing. It inspired me, to create this safe haven of music making.

Imagine walking around the metaverse with your own avatar, walking inside a building that looks like a big planet and finding a lobby with more like-minded musicians, and being able to make new connections and work on songs together as a group, or alone, on the setup provided in the studio, next to the lobby.
Users will be able to upload their songs or start new songs from scratch. Also will users be able to apply changes to the seperate sounds/stems like: add, improve, edit, delete and re-arrange.
All this from their own computer, at their comfortable home.

The lobby will be a forum for beat-producers, engineers, instrument players and vocal artists, to offer their services to each other, or do collabs.
And if all goes well, there will also be a performance stage, for all the artists to perform their songs, and promote their brand. Users can also charge entrance fee's for their concerts, to fund their musical journey and buy themselves better audio gear for example.
This virtual studio will even attract big and established artists, because it is a way faster, and more intuitive workflow, then e-mailing stems back and forth. Plus this way you can really meet and vibe in the studio, together with your co-artist(s), mixing engineer and/or beat-producer from other sides of the world.

We will need another 23,000 usd, to kickstart the project with some marketing and promotion.
With this money we will do Remix Contests and workshops done by famous musicians, with prizes like hardware & software gear, musical instruments or recording equipment. We will also ask brands to donate discount vouchers to our prize pool.
This way we make sure the studio will be very actively used and our users will grow mentally, and find the international artists within themselves.


Of course we can start building with less, and we are very resourceful when the amount is not reached. But the more funds, the smoother the launch will unfold, and the more detailed the studio will be, as you can imagine.
This amount is just to launch it, of course, and we will need way more eventually to keep it up to date, add new features, build more studios and expand. But we will be able to offer advertising, product placement and sponsoring by big music brands, to continue this awesome journey.



 


The Impact

As more and more people struggle with mental issues nowadays, music can be a successful therapy, because when we make music, we use mainly the right (creative) side of our brain, instead of our left (rational) part, where all mental problems are usually stored.

Mentaverse is also building the brand in the NFT world for 2 years now, we recently launched our Planet collection, will launch our $MVC token soon and we are also developing our own resource type game, where people can build their own civilisations, buildings, roads and cities on their own planets.



We already accumulated some funds from the Planet sales, but first of all; that’s not enough, and second of all; we will need those funds to keep growing and promoting the Mentaverse NFT project and to attract more investors.
That’s why we need separate funds to build this virtual music production studio.
We have established a very loyal community on discord and twitter, who are very excited to see this studio inside Income Island, happening.

Our goal is to eliminate mental problems as much as possible, worldwide, by using the power of music creation.

With your help we can get this done properly.
 

 

Risks and Challenges

Mentaverse is connected with many very talented developers and coders, so building this studio will only be a matter of time and money. Where it gets harder is, to eventually make millions of users be active in there, on a daily basis. Only then, advertisers, and sponsors will be interested to join financially.

But as I worked for a few door-to-door sales companies and as an account manager for some international investment companies in my younger years, I know how to add more excitement and action, by promoting it inside our community and to new investors. Besides this, I am also very confident that Income Island will attract many users, as they are already a big company, with many other established companies building in there.
Another way to attract more users, is to collaborate with studio brands and do giveaways together, with for example, free plugins and other audio gear, from well known music companies. And all the song/remix contests and free workshops will also attract new users.

The screenshots you see, are showing how we are building the prototype of our virtual studio in Unity.
Of course this will just be a sketch/quick draw, to make our idea and pitch, more visual.
The final metaverse shell, will be built by the professioinal development team, from Income Island.

For the recording & production hub/platform, we will need to hire devs, that can launch it as browser as well as phone app.
We also need server and cloud storage for all the audio files, uploaded or recorded by the end-users and for all the software plugins that need to run smoothly, in the studio as well as in the band room.
