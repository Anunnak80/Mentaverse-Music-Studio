# Mentaverse-Music-Studio
Interactive, online studio connecting beat producers, engineers and artists, in the metaverse.

*Introduction*

My name is Vlad, I‚Äôm 43 years, studied SAE in Rotterdam, and graduated as Audio Engineer.
Since then, I‚Äôm running my own recording / mixing studio for at least 20 years now, in The Netherlands. My idea is to build a virtual, interactive, online music studio, so everyone worldwide can create music together.

This idea came from my i.r.l. job, over at https://www.hvbrecords.nl .
We guide people with mental problems like: light autism, psychoses, split personalities, army veterans, people who suffer from substance abuse, ex-convicts, etc etc, how to write, create, record, mix and promote their own music. This way we help them to escape from their daily sorrows and feel more confident.

Music has the power to prevent people from suicide!

I am also the founder of Mentaverse (on Solana), for the last 3 years, and ongoing.

Mentaverse is short for Mental Verse, as we cheer for better mental health, worldwide.
We also believe that we, humans, are wearing the universe inside ourselves.



 



What I would like to build on Solana, is a virtual online music-production studio, that gives everyone access, to join and create songs, together, from wherever they are at that moment and without needing to own expensive studio software.

*The Plan*

The group of mental clients, that I work with in real life, amaze me every time, how musical and talented they are, and it gives me hope to see them shine and revive with happiness, the moment they start playing or singing. It inspired me, to create this safe haven of music making.

Imagine walking around the metaverse with your own avatar, walking inside a building that looks like a big planet and finding a lobby with more like-minded musicians, and being able to make new connections and work on songs together as a group, or alone, on the setup provided in the studio, next to the lobby.
Users will be able to upload their songs or start new songs from scratch. Also will users be able to apply changes to the seperate sounds/stems like: add, improve, edit, delete and re-arrange.
All this from their own computer, at their comfortable home.

The lobby will be a forum for beat-producers, engineers, instrument players and vocal artists, to offer their services to each other, or do collabs. And on the big screen we will showcase songs, interviews and tutorials.
If all goes well, there will also be a performance stage, for all the artists to perform their songs, and promote their brand. Users can also charge entrance fee's for their concerts, to fund their musical journey and buy themselves better audio gear for example.
This virtual studio will even attract big and established artists, because it is a way faster, and more intuitive workflow, then e-mailing stems back and forth. Plus this way you can really meet and vibe in the studio, together with your co-artist(s), mixing engineer and/or beat-producer from other sides of the world.

We will need to kickstart the project with some marketing and promotion.
We will do Remix Contests and workshops done by famous musicians, with prizes like hardware & software gear, musical instruments or recording equipment. We will also ask brands to donate discount vouchers to our prize pool.
This way we make sure the studio will be very actively used and our users will grow mentally, and find the international artists within themselves.


We will be able to offer advertising, product placement and sponsoring by big music brands, to continue this awesome journey.

*The Impact*

As more and more people struggle with mental issues nowadays, music can be a successful therapy, because when we make music, we use mainly the right (creative) side of our brain, instead of our left (rational) part, where all mental problems are usually stored.

Mentaverse is also building the brand in the Solana NFT world for 3 years now, we launched our Planet collection and recently launched our Star collection as well.
We will launch our $MVC token soon and we are also developing our own resource type game, where people can build their own civilisations, buildings, roads and cities on their own planets.
Holders will be able to add the virtual studio on their Planets, in combination with a Star NFT.


*Here some more details about the Planet and Star NFT's:*

The remaining Planets that we burned earlier last year, came back as Stars! üî• üí´ 
We went for a totally different art style as we used for the Planets, because in real life stars are also very different from planets.
They have totally different behaviours and personalities.
As music artists are also called "stars", we decided to implement this in our virtual studio mechanism!

This means that every holder that has a Planet, as well as a Star in the same wallet, will be able to build their own studio, on their Planet (as soon as we launched the virtual studio).
This also means that every Planet/Star pair will unlock the option to add a virtual studio on that Planet.
 ü•Å üéπ üéôÔ∏è üé∏ 

In time, after we gathered more funds from grant givers, sponsors, advertisement and product placement, all studio holders will be able to make their studio available for the public and start earning SOL or $MVC everytime their studio is being used!

*As you may have seen, some Star NFT's have the "extra gear" trait...*

This could vary from vocal effects, synthesizer soundbanks, drum samples & loops, guitar sounds & amps, mixing effects and mastering effects!
If you hold Stars with these traits, you will get that premium trait, for free! 
So for example if your Star has "drums" as an extra gear trait, your studio will have extra drum samples, that non-premium accounts don't have!
This does not mean, the free account will not have drum samples at all, it just means the premium account will have more samples and sound banks to choose from.
If you don't have a Star with that trait, but you still want to have all the extra's, you can subscribe for a premium account, which will cost $4.99 per month.

There are also other traits like "inside" or "outside" angle, "partner" Stars and a few "anomaly" traits. 
More will be explained about these traits later. All i can say for now, is that the more rare your trait is, the higher your studio staking rewards will be (in the future). üìà

We have established a very loyal community on discord and twitter, who are very excited to see this studio, happening.
Our goal is to eliminate mental problems as much as possible, worldwide, by using the power of music creation.




Here you can see a sneakpeek video of the progress, so far:

This is a sketch of the app part we did last year:

Real prototype will look totally different and is being written from scratch, as we speak.

*Risks and Challenges*

Mentaverse is connected with many very talented developers and coders, so building this studio will only be a matter of time and money. Where it gets harder is, to eventually make millions of users be active in there, on a daily basis. Only then, advertisers, and sponsors will be interested to join financially.

But as I worked for a few door-to-door sales companies and as an account manager for some international investment companies in my younger years, I know how to add more excitement and action, by promoting it inside our community and to new investors. 
Another way to attract more users, is to collaborate with studio brands and do giveaways together, with for example, free plugins and other audio gear, from well known music companies. And all the song/remix contests and free workshops will also attract new users.

*The screenshots you see, are showing how we are building the prototype of our virtual studio in Unity.
Of course this will just be a sketch/quick draw, to make our idea and pitch, more visual.
The final metaverse shell, will be built by the professioinal development team, that Mentaverse partnered up with.*

*For the recording & production hub/platform, our devs will launch it as browser, as well as, phone app.
We also are looking for more server and cloud storage for all the audio files, uploaded or recorded by the end-users and for all the software plugins that need to run smoothly, in the studio as well as in the band room.*
